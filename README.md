## About Product

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- first create database on your system with name shop.
- run -> (php artisan migrate --seed) to migrate tables and seed users.
- run -> (php artisan serve).
- open address http://127.0.0.1:8000/login.
- login by user: administrator@1ta100.com and pass:password.
- grant permissions add or edit or update to admin or test user or create other users and granted them.
- create product and use system.
